### Database Architecture
The following database structure is used to store information about products, categories, users, orders, and reviews:

- Table "Products"
- Table "Categories"

- Table "Orders"
- Table "Reviews"

Each table has unique identifiers (Primary Keys) and relationships with other tables (Foreign Keys), ensuring data integrity and connections between entities in the online store database.
